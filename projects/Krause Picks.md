# Krause Picks

Krause Picks was a daily NBA pick 'em game built in collaboration with Krause House. Over the course of the 2023-2024 NBA season 279 users across 7 communities participated to make 37,000 picks. The project was built in Next.js and used Postgres as its database.

The application was sunset after the 2023 regular season, but you can find the code [here](https://github.com/gregfromstl/krause-picks).
