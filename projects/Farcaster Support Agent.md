# Farcaster Support Agent

A simple AI agent trained on the Farcaster docs and made available via frame and XTMP using [Operator](https://operator.io). I built this project when Farcaster user growth was surging and many new users had questions surrounding the protocol. The project seemed to help some people and reduced some of the FAQs that would spam the network.

2,500+ questions were asked in the first 3 days Hundreds of accounts interacted with the agent and expressed its usefulness Agent is available both in a frame and via XMTP wallet-based messaging at farcaster-support.agentid.eth

The agent provided some exceptional answers to common yet complicated questions such as: Q: What's the difference between Warpcast and Farcaster? A: Warpcast is an app that allows users to access the Farcaster decentralized social network. Farcaster is the underlying social network itself.

Q: What's a warp? A: A warp is a way to perform onchain actions within the Warpcast app. It is specific to Warpcast and is not onchain.

Q: How is Farcaster onchain if it doesn't cost me any ETH to post? A: Farcaster's onchian systems are used for critical actions such as creating an account, paying rent for data storage, or adding account keys for connected apps. Posting on Farcaster does not incur a direct cost in ETH because it utilizes offchain systems, where actions are performed without requiring onchain transactions.

The project has since been sunset to save on costs. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/gregfromstl/farcaster-support-agent).
