# Farcaster Accounts Dashboard

Farcaster Accounts is a dashboard for creating and managing accounts outside of any client using an in-browser wallet. The project is primarily meant for developers needing to create client-agnostic accounts to use for bots. The app is built in Next.js and integrates directly with the Farcaster contracts for account creation and [Neynar](https://docs.neynar.com) for account management. Custody account details are encrypted and stored in Supabase for easy exporting of keys.

You can find the code for the project [here](https://github.com/gregfromstl/farcaster-accounts).
