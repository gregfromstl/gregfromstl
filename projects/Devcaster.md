# Devcaster

Devcaster was a library for declaritively creating Farcaster frames in Next.js apps. The long-term use case for frames isn't "frame-only" applications, but the extension of standalone applications into social media feeds via frames. Devcaster used this philosophy to create the first reactive, stateful Farcaster frames. The library's API gave developers JSX-style components to built frames directly within their application's logic.

As libraries with considerably more backing quickly adopted Devcaster's design philosophy into their own, I decided to deprecate the library. Today, I'd recommend [Frog](https://frog.fm) to anyone building Frames.
