# Farcaster Political Compass

A simple frame that uses your past casts to determine where you are on the political compass. When a user clicks the frame, it reads there past N casts, creates an embedding for them, and compares this embedding to embeddings of some directional prompts. It then performs normalization based on past results to determine the user's coordinates on the compass and display them back to the frame.

The actual results have mixed accuracy, partly because this is an oversimplified approach meant to be a fun game, partially because 250 character casts aren't the best judge of most peoples' political stance. It was a fun experiment and some notable people like Vitalik tried it out. This was my first frame and was built using my own library called [Devcaster]().

You can find the code for the project [here](https://github.com/gregfromstl/farcaster-political-compass), but the production version has been sunset as it was costing me too much in mistral embedding credits.
