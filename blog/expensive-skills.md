# Expensive Skills
Not every skill exists in the same dimension. It’s the difference between the hobbyist practitioner and the master craftsman. I call the former “inexpensive skills” and the latter “expensive skills”. Inexpensive skills are quick to get and plentiful in supply. Expensive skills are difficult to acquire, to the extent they become rare and sought after.

1. Expensive skills are rare (limited supply)
2. Expensive skills are desirable (excessive demand)

Many expensive skills can fall into the same category as an inexpensive skill but differ beyond a simple level of expertise. Sports are a great example here. Many people know how to play baseball. They know the rules and can follow along as they watch a game. They may have even played on a team growing up. Much fewer people can understand the game of baseball the way a major league player might. The way the pitcher grips the ball, how the batter reads the spin mid-throw, or how to foul off a pitch in the zone that isn’t quite where you’d like it. If you listen to a casual baseball fan recall a game you’ll notice a difference compared to how a player would. The difference between expensive and inexpensive skills is the difference between being on the field and in the bleachers.

We all want to be an expert at something. So if they’re so desirable why are they so rare? Why isn’t everyone a professional athlete? When you hear someone talk about their journey to their expensive skill they’ll mention things like “passion” or “hard work”. This is bullshit. If passion were what led you to an expensive skill they’d be much more common. Remember, an expensive skill is something rare. So what’s the real reason some people acquire expensive skills while most of us remain average? Expensive skills are usually the product of forced circumstance. For one reason or another you find yourself practicing day in and day out. Your dad might be a professional athlete, so you’re pushed into sports at a young age. Both Kobe Bryant’s father and uncle were NBA players, and he started playing basketball at the age of three.

We all practice something every day. We drag ourselves to 9-5s where we’re forced to practice the same skill day in and day out. Those skills are clearly in demand; we’re being paid for them after all. But you won’t find anyone making millions a year building Excel forecasts. That’s because they're in plentiful supply. What separates the inexpensive 9-5ers and the expensive skills is the limited supply. The only thing that puts you in a bracket of limited supply is an unhealthy obsession. A need to go beyond what you’re initially forced to do. It’s almost impulsive. You have to be batshit crazy to reach a level of skill that 99% of people don’t and can’t have. My favorite description of this is from Charles Bukowski:

> “If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery--isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is.”

But how is this not the same thing as passion? Passion is often described as something you choose up front. Something you see another doing and feel called to. Real expensive skills start out of necessity, and turn into obsession. You will only become obsessed with something when you taste your ability for it, and you will only taste your ability once you’ve reached a basic above average level of skill. This is why expensive skills are becoming increasingly rare. As the barrier to acquire an inexpensive skill disappears, the initial starting energy to find an obsession is never expended. You’re left drifting from one skill to the next, never going deep enough to become enthralled with any of them.. We’ll have more breadth of expertise than any time in history, but depth will be shallow and unmeaningful.

The world has never made it easier to pick up inexpensive skills. A few hours, a few tutorials, and a few clever prompts get you enough dopamine to feel competent. Despite “learning” a topic, the medium through which this introduction comes is unrelated to the expensive version of the skill. Why would I ever write a line of code if an LLM can do it better? Why would I ever become a doctor if AI can diagnose things better than I can? We are all stuck on top of Mount Stupid, unwilling to experience the long journey to reach skills beyond what our AI companions offer. You can already see the widespread complacency and pandemic of “good enough”. We’re entering an era of intellectual laziness. Humanity will think it knows everything, while understanding nothing. We’ll be subservient to our own creations long before they reach general intelligence. Expensive skils and the pursuit of mastery will become extinct.
