# Code as Self

Any code you write is a manifestation of your current internal state:

If you’re rushed, your code will become rushed.

If you’re tired, your code will be tired.

If you misunderstand the task, your code will misunderstand the task.

If you’re frustrated, your code will be frustrated. 

If you’re calm and have a clear view of the solution at hand, the code will too.

It’s more than bugs and poor readability. What we create inherits the personality we have at the time of creation. Tired code will be verbose -- it takes longer to recognize what would seem obvious to someone who’s awake and alert. Frustrated code will try to do too much, often overcomplicating what could be simple.

This sounds obvious, but how often do you think about your current mood when programming? When was the last time you adjusted your mood to help your work? We see the work we do as distinct from our mental state, but in reality its a product of our mental state. The same way kids inherit their parents’ DNA, anything you create inherits your state of mind.
